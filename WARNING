Writing on unknown EEPROMs can brake your computer. 

DIMMs contain an EEPROM and if you overwrite it somehow your computer 
will not boot anymore.

Reading using 16bit addressing (i.e. not using the -8 switch) on a 8bit EEPROM 
can actually WRITE to the EEPROM. Be careful. 

The following chips use 8bit mode:
	24C01
	24C02
	24C04
	24C08
	24C16

Bigger ones use 16bit addressing so you must not use -8.

More could need it, check data sheets.

If you are not sure about what you're doing DON'T use this tool.
